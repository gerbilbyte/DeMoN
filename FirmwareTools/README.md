These tools can be used to set up the firmware for your DeMoN cartridge.
<pre>
*DeMoN_patcher.py - This script patches an original Action Replay 3 ROM by applying the DeMoN patch file. 
*firmwareSplitter.py - This is a python script that will split the ROM file into two halfs to be copied to the relevant ROM chips.
*FirmwareCombine.py - Interleves two (or more) files into one file. Ideal for reconstructing firmwares taken from the U7 and U9 chips.
